# CI_adminlte_Template
this is a Codeigniter - adminLTE template integration. Use this template to begin your projects. Is simple and functional.
Clone the project in your www or public_html folder and make this change:
1. Go to "application/config/config.php" and find the line "$config['base_url'] = 'http://'. $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].'/yourproject';". Replacer the string "yourproject" with the name of the root folder of your project
with this change you can view the template on the server.

After, configure database configuration if needed. 
I will integrate ion auth soon.

Thanks.
